 islamic_authoritarian_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_banner_islamic_authoritarianism\n\n\n\n\n\n§YIslamic Authoritarianism§! is an ideology advocating for a strong centralized authority with Islamic characteristics. Heavily associated with the International Union of Muslim States, it was developed during the Khartoumese Civil War and the IUMS occupation period. It encompasses a broad set of beliefs including traditionalism, Islamism, Third-Worldism and anti-Occitanism. Though not inherently anti-democratic, it has drifted away from semi-democratic practices to heavily authoritarian leanings with the Hesperidian Crisis. Though it vanished along with the IUMS, current geopolitical events like Rûmi Civil War presents an opportunity for it to rise again and perhaps along with a similar organization to IUMS."
