 maoism: "Maoism"
 maoism_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Ideology_maoist\n\n\n\n\n\n§YMaoism§! is an advanced form of Marxism-Leninism synthesized by Peruvian theorist and guerllia fighter Chairman Gonzalo in 1982. It builds off the earlier theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao ZeDong thought, and states that Mao's writings were universally applicable. It's key principles are Protracted People's War, which advocates for a guerllia war against the Capitalist states, Cultural Revolution to rid culture from bourgoise influence, and the Mass Line, which argues that a Vanguard Party must outline a strategy for the revolutionary leadership of the masses, consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and strengthening of the party and for the building of socialism."
 
 jacobinism: "Jacobinism"
 jacobinism_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Ideology_jacobin\n\n\n\n\n\n§YJacobinism§! traces its heritage back to the 1789 with the French Revolution. Placing heavy emphasis on civic nationalism, patriotism and the struggle for §YNational Sovereignty§! in an increasingly hostile world, Jacobin regimes turn to authoritarian methods of control in order to preserve the revolution against its enemies. In order to protect the revolution and forge a new world, Jacobin regimes utilize extensive use of mass surveillance systems, secret police and webs of informants, as well as seeking to control every sector of life, from economics to family dynamics. Paradoxically, Jacobinism draws its legitimacy primarily through populism, resorting to populist measures in order to placate the people, favoring wealth redistribution, extensive social safety nets, as well as more conservative social policies in order to maintain the support of their primarily rural bases of support. While many similarities to the original Jacobinism of the French Revolution do remain, the new Jacobinism of the 21st Century represents a synthesis of the old and the new - the ushering in of a communist society, no matter how high the cost may be."

It views the system as a decaying structure capable of being driven beyond its limits in order to reveal new forms of social empowerment, political power, and technological development. Capitalism's grip can be escaped through post-scarcity economics, automation, and artificial intelligence."
